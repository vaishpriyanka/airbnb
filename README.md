I conducted an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings in New York to identify key trends in pricing, occupancy, and user engagement. My findings will be presented in two focused sessions:

1️⃣ Data Analysis Team – Insights on data trends, pricing models, and property performance to optimize analytical processes.
2️⃣ Business Strategy Team – Actionable recommendations for property acquisitions, pricing strategies, and user experience enhancements to maximize revenue and engagement.

By leveraging data-driven insights, my analysis will help Airbnb make informed decisions to improve operations, attract high-value properties, and enhance customer experience. 🚀
